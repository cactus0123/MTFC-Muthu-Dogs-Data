# MTFC-Muthu-Dogs-Data
Our team, the Muthu Dogs, participating in the Modeling the Future Challenge is coming up with a mathematical model to solve a problem. We are specifically aiming to mitigate risk in driverless car accidents. For our solution, we need data on precipitation based on city and town names. This data would then be used in our mathematical model to identify what are the most significant factors in driverless car accidents. This code was used to gather data using several API's allowing us to pursue our mathematical model.
